CORE (COllaborative Research Environment) is a website where anyone with access to the Internet can participate in academic research. Also researchers across the globe can collaborate on research endeavors.

CORE is currently being built with React.js and Node.js.

Use babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch to have Babel simultaneously convert code to Javascript that the browser can read. 

All code must be well documented with comments, so one with no familiarity with the code can understand how the code can relate to which part of the project.
